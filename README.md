## What's Included

This is a basic environment that should be ready to expand upon to build a day-to-day development envrionment for Haskell. It comes with the following software choices:

### Haskell Tools

The image comes with the following tooling:

- [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/): installer and toolchain manager
- [cabal-install](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/): a common package manager

- [ghc](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/): Haskell's de-facto compiler
- [hlint](https://github.com/ndmitchell/hlint): Haskell's de-facto linter
- [ghcid](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid): A simple daemon for compiling and running code when it changes
- [haskell-language-server](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server#readme): [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) integration
